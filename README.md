move : wasd <br>
climb up: up arrow <br>

### quick desctribtion for what i did.
I added the health bars, the player, and its attacking function. I made the bullet damage the enemies, and I made the foundation of the first level, but I didn't finish it. Also, I finished the main menu. Still, I must do the levels and the sponsors and the function that makes the enemies attack you.

I added the winning function, losing to the attack of the enemies, and a detecting system for the enemy. Also, I added some sounds and some decor, and that's all.
